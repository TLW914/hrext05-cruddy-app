### Cruddy App Todo

#### Basic Improvments (requirements)

- [ ] create indivdiual items
- [ ] delete individual items
- [ ] edit individual items

##### Notes
- [ ] Keep DOM and localStorage matching
- [ ] Remember event Delegation when adding new items to .show-text
- [ ] make sure we do not duplicate data
- [ ] add different values to the item

  ex.
```javascript
 item =  {
  id: "thing used for key",
  text-value: "some text",
  categories: [ 'cat1', 'cat2' ],
  isComplete: boolean,
  dateCreated: dateCreated,
  dateCompleted: dateCompleted
  ...
  etc
  }
```

#### Potential Libraries
- [ ] lodash/underscore
- [ ] jquery ui
- [x] bootstrap/material (css library)

#### My Spin
- [x] CRUD functionality for generating a fantasy sports lineup
- [x] Use c3 js library for player data visualization
- [x] bootstrap for styling
- [x] potentially use underscore

#### Rough Plan
- [] Day 1 - Sketch out MVP - determine browser capacity for data, find how to convert csv's into JSON for c3 library
- [] Day 2 - Get basic requirements outlined
- [] Day 2 - Get a rough implementation of basic requirements
- [] Day 2 - Clean up basic implementation
- [] Day 3 - Complete strategy for your Feature 1
- [] Day 3 - Implement solution for Feature 1
- [] Day 4 - Complete strategy for your Feature 2
- [] Day 4 - Implement solution for Feature 2
- [] Day 5 - Prep to present
